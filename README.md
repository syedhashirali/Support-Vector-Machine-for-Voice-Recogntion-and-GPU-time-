# Support-Vector-Machine-for-Voice-Recogntion-and-GPU-time-
In this project I use two sets of data to classify male and female voices based on frequencies and other statistical measures. I use the second data to predict the GPU run time of an algorithm. the algorithm used is Support Vector Machines. I used linear, radial and sigmoid kernel for this algorithm. The kernel trick improves model performance. I also take several measures including normalization, distributed computing, cross-validation etc. to improve model performance and reduce computing time for the algorithms. .
